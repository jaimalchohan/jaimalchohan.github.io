I've just released the first pre-release version of [MiniWebDeploy](https://github.com/jaimalchohan/mini-web-deploy) to [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MiniWebDeploy/0.6.0)  It's a really simple web deployment tool whose purpose to make configuring IIS7 easier.  It's all on the [README](https://github.com/jaimalchohan/mini-web-deploy/blob/master/README.md)  It's pretty basic for now and needs a lot more work, but this version is stable.

The core problem I've tried to solve is one where you have to automatically configure IIS after publishing your website to a server.  Usually this is a manual process (and lost in the ether of 'uhh, how did I do this last time...?') or involves scripts around AppCmd.exe.  Using **MiniWebDeploy** this configuration becomes part of your site, and you can test it. Awesome!

Feel free to contribute!
