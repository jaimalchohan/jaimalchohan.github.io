Coming from a developer, living in a database driven world, it sounds like it shouldn't be a thing, but this entire blog is **STATIC**. I used [Ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com/), a static site generator written by [plusjade](https://github.com/plusjade) to generate my site and [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) to host it.

###How

[Ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com/) is a static site generator written by [plusjade](https://github.com/plusjade), who also wrote a [jekyll-bootstrap](https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap).  [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is the most well known and probably most widely adopted static site generator out there, and [jekyll-bootstrap](https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap) is the fastest and easiest way to get a site generated via [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) onto [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) but [plusjade](https://github.com/plusjade) has decided to focus his efforts on [Ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com/) 

> http://ruhoh.com solves many frustrations found in Jekyll which results in the need for JB [Jekyll Bootstrap] in the first place. 

###Where do I start

The developer guide at [Ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com/) is concise and easy to follow, and you can find the actual source used to build this very blog in [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/jaimalchohan/jaimalchohan.github.io/tree/gh-pages). The guide isn't always as terse as it needs to be, so use my repository as a reference when things don't work.  

You should probably have some experience of using git and ruby.


###Why not Wordpress?

I've used WP several times over the years, and in my opinion it's always been the best of a bad bunch, the codebase is heavy, the editor has little bugs and generates unclean syntax, and if I want to edit the theme or use a custom domain I have to pay $99 a year or host my own. And all of this for a product most of whose features I don't really need.  I tried other blogging platforms, that all annoyed me in the same way.
