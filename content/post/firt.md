I don't usually care for motivational posters (unless it's a [motivational drinking poster](http://imgur.com/gallery/i0Wt7)) but this one resounded with me.

I don't run for any goal.


I don't take part in group running or competative running.

I've run half marathons but never an orgaised one.  

For me running is about freedom, about finding peace with myself, remembering what actually matters to me, I run for me.

When you're doing something to better youself it doesn't matter whether you do it for a minute or an hour, good or bad, you've done something and that's winning.
